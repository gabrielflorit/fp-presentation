// Tips:
// - never use a for/forEach loop again! most array operations can be done with map
//   - some languages don't have for loops (e.g. haskell and scheme)
// - write small functions that do one thing only
// - use map's execution context to avoid polluting your global scope
// - embrace ES6 arrows and implicit returns, it makes a big difference
//
